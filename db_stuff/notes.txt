setting up the mongodb db

- I'm using windows so after installing MongoDB community, follow "Run MongoDB Community Edition from the Command Interpreter"
  from https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/
  - some helpful commands:
    - show dbs
    - show collections
    - use <database-name>
    - db.<collection-name>.find() to show all documents in a collection

- Since MongoDB creates a new database only when we add new documents/records, we don't have to do anything beforehand
  (see https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/databases-and-collections/)
  We can run the piano roll app now! :D


// misc
you'll need >= node v14 to be able to run the server (b/c of mongoose)
