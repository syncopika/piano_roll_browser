- need to spend some time checking the math for calculating start times (precision)? - watch out for drift
  
- looping implementation was questionable and removed for now

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioParam/cancelAndHoldAtTime is not supported in Firefox and 
  I'm using it :/

current things to do now:
  - some kind of visual signal for note volume?
  - use sliders for changing value of volume, pan instead of dropdown
  - improve percussion
    - no panning currently
  - the pianoNotes div (i.e. mobile piano bar) implementation could be cleaned up a bit maybe?
  - add metronome? is scheduler scheduling on time?
  - accessibility?
  - maybe make it at least a little mobile friendly, i.e. support also touch events?
  - refactor? things like play and stopPlay - should those be piano roll methods instead of standalone functions?
