- need to spend some time checking the math for calculating start times? - watch out for drift

- on Firefox: when playing my demos (except for the 3/4 example), the first note always seems to be skipped.
  otherwise, performance on Firefox seems to have improved considerably from at least a year ago for my application.
  
- looping implementation was questionable and removed for now

current things to do now:
	- some kind of visual signal for note volume?
	- use sliders for changing value of volume, pan instead of dropdown
	- improve percussion
	  - no panning currently
	- the pianoNotes div (i.e. mobile piano bar) implementation could be cleaned up a bit maybe?
	- add metronome? is scheduler scheduling on time?
	- accessibility?
	- maybe make it at least a little mobile friendly, i.e. support also touch events?
	- refactor? things like play and stopPlay - should those be piano roll methods instead of standalone functions?
